# üìã Instructions for Uploading TaskFlow Pro to GitHub

## üéØ **What This Project Is**

**TaskFlow Pro** is a professional task management web application with an **intentional bug** for demonstration purposes. It's perfect for creating GitHub issues and showing problem-solving skills!

### **Key Features:**
- Full Flask web application with authentication
- Task management with projects, priorities, due dates
- Analytics dashboard with charts
- RESTful API endpoints
- Professional Bootstrap UI
- Docker deployment ready

### **The Intentional Bug üêõ**
- **Location**: `app/views/tasks.py` - `delete_task()` function
- **Problem**: Cascading deletion doesn't work properly
- **Effect**: Deleting tasks with subtasks leaves orphaned records
- **Perfect for**: Creating a realistic GitHub issue

## üöÄ **How to Upload to Your GitHub Account**

### **Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub**
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and login
2. Click the **"+"** button ‚Üí **"New repository"**
3. Name it: `taskflow-pro` or `task-management-system`
4. Description: `Professional Task Management System with Analytics - Flask Web App`
5. Make it **Public** (so others can see the issue)
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub**
```bash
cd /path/to/Prayerify  # Navigate to the project folder
git remote remove origin  # Remove existing remote (if any)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/taskflow-pro.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 3: Verify Upload**
- Refresh your GitHub repository page
- You should see all the files including README.md
- The commit message should mention "TaskFlow Pro - Professional Task Management System"

## üêõ **Creating the Bug Demonstration Issue**

After uploading, create a GitHub issue:

### **Issue Title:**
`üêõ Task Deletion Bug: Cascading deletion not working properly - orphaned subtasks remain`

### **Issue Description:**
```markdown
## Bug Description
When deleting a parent task that has subtasks, the deletion process doesn't properly handle related records, causing data inconsistency and orphaned subtasks.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone and run the application:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/taskflow-pro.git
   cd taskflow-pro
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   flask seed-db
   python app.py
   ```

2. Login with demo account:
   - Username: `demo_user`
   - Password: `DemoPassword123`

3. Find the "Launch product beta" task (it has 2 subtasks)
4. Click delete on the parent task
5. Check the database - subtasks remain but reference deleted parent

## Expected Behavior
- All related subtasks should be either deleted or made independent
- Related comments and attachments should be cleaned up
- No orphaned records should remain

## Actual Behavior
- Parent task gets deleted
- Subtasks remain with invalid parent_task_id references
- Comments and attachments are not cleaned up
- Database referential integrity is broken

## Technical Details
- **File**: `app/views/tasks.py`
- **Function**: `delete_task()` (lines 198-232)
- **Issue**: Missing cascading deletion logic

## Environment
- Python 3.9+
- Flask 2.3.3
- SQLAlchemy 2.0.21

## Additional Context
This bug demonstrates common database relationship pitfalls and the importance of proper cascade handling in web applications.
```

### **Labels to Add:**
- `bug` 
- `database`
- `good first issue`
- `help wanted`

## üí° **For the Person Who Will "Fix" the Bug**

### **The Solution** (save this for later):

Replace the buggy code in `app/views/tasks.py:delete_task()` with:

```python
# PROPER CASCADE DELETION:
# 1. Handle subtasks
subtasks = Task.query.filter_by(parent_task_id=task.id).all()
for subtask in subtasks:
    subtask.parent_task_id = None  # Make independent

# 2. Delete related comments
for comment in task.comments:
    db.session.delete(comment)

# 3. Delete related attachments
for attachment in task.attachments:
    db.session.delete(attachment)

# 4. Finally delete the main task
db.session.delete(task)
db.session.commit()
```
